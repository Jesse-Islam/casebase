# S4 objects ----

#' An S4 class to store the output of fitSmoothHazard
#'
#' This class inherits from \code{vglm-class}.
#'
#' @slot originalData Data.frame containing the original data (i.e. before
#'   case-base sampling). This is used by the \code{\link{absoluteRisk}}
#'   function.
#' @slot typeEvents Numeric factor which encodes the type of events being
#'   considered (including censoring).
#' @slot timeVar Character string giving the name of the time variable, as
#'   appearing in \code{originalData}
#' @slot eventVar Character string giving the name of the event variable, as
#'   appearing in \code{originalData}
#' @importClassesFrom VGAM vglm
