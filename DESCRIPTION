Description: Implements the case-base sampling approach of Hanley and Miettinen (2009) <DOI:10.2202/1557-4679.1125>, 
    Saarela and Arjas (2015) <DOI:10.1111/sjos.12125>, and Saarela (2015) <DOI:10.1007/s10985-015-9352-x>, for fitting flexible hazard 
    regression models to survival data with single event type or multiple competing causes via logistic and multinomial regression. 
    From the fitted hazard function, cumulative incidence, risk functions of time, treatment and profile 
    can be derived. This approach accommodates any log-linear hazard function of prognostic time, treatment, 
    and covariates, and readily allows for non-proportionality. We also provide a plot method for visualizing 
    incidence density via population time plots.
