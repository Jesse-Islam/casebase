# Mkdocs: HOW-TO

This explains how to run the mkdocs. But first you need to install `mkdocs` and the third-party theme `material`.

```
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
```

1. Create a .Rmd in the docs folder. The .Rmd should have this at the top:

---
title: "data"
author: "Sahir"
date: "January 22, 2017"
output:
  md_document:
    variant: markdown
---

See http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/markdown_document_format.html for different variants

For .Rmd documents with LaTeX in it (e.g. simulations.Rmd), I used
---
output:
  md_document:
    variant: markdown
---

For everything else I used
---
output:
  md_document:
    variant: markdown_github
---

2. click on knit. this will make an .md document in the docs/ folder

3. Add the name of the page and the .md document to mkdocs.yml (which is located in the root folder)

To (re)generate the site, run the following command from the root folder (the one that has the YAML file for the site):

```
mkdocs build
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

4. For mathjax:

first make sure you have root permissions on the python folder:

```
which python
python --version
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/python3.5
```

then install python markdown math extension (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27882261/mkdocs-and-mathjax):

```
pip install https://github.com/mitya57/python-markdown-math/archive/master.zip
```

add the folowing to the YAML file

```
extra_javascript:
    - http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML

markdown_extensions:
    - mdx_math
```

## Further comments

    - used `knitr::kable(format = "html")` for tables, but still had to manually remove backslashes on underscores in the .md file

    - also had to manually remove backslahes on exponents in the .md file
