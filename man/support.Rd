\title{Study to Understand Prognoses Preferences Outcomes and Risks of Treatment (SUPPORT)}
\format{A dataframe with 9104 observations and 34 variables after imputation and the removal of response variables like hospital charges, patient ratio of costs to charges and micro-costs. Ordinal variables, namely functional disability and income were removed. Finally, Surrogate activities of daily living were removed due to sparsity. There were 6 other model scores in the data-set and they were removed; only aps and sps were kept. \describe{ \item{Age}{ Stores a double representing age. } \item{death}{ Death at any time up to NDI date: 31DEC94. } \item{sex}{ 0=female, 1=male. } \item{slos}{ Days from study entry to discharge. } \item{d.time}{ days of follow-up. } \item{dzgroup}{ Each level of dzgroup: ARF/MOSF w/Sepsis, COPD, CHF, Cirrhosis, Coma, Colon Cancer, Lung Cancer, MOSF with malignancy. } \item{dzclass}{ ARF/MOSF, COPD/CHF/Cirrhosis, Coma and cancer disease classes. } \item{num.co}{ the number of comorbidities. } \item{edu}{ years of education of patient. } \item{scoma}{ The SUPPORT coma score based on Glasgow D3. } \item{avtisst}{ Average TISS, days 3-25. } \item{race}{ Indicates race.

\usage{
support
}
\description{
The support datasets track four response variables: hospital death, severe functional disability, hospital costs and time until death and death itself. where the patients are followed for up to 5.56 years. Data included only tracks follow-up time and death
}
\details{
Data from the first phase of the SUPPORT study. We imputed the data-set using default settings in mice package.

\examples{
data("support")
mod_cb <- casebase::fitSmoothHazard(death ~ .,

                                    ratio = 5)

# Or with the matrix interface and log of time
x <- model.matrix(death ~ . - d.time - 1, data = support)
y <- with(support, cbind(death, d.time))

fit_cb <- casebase::fitSmoothHazard.fit(x, y, time = "d.time", event = "death",
