This vignette introduces the main functions in the `casebase` package.
The methods implemented in this package are based on the theory
developped in [*Fitting Smooth-in-Time Prognostic Risk Functions via
Logistic Regression (Hanley and Miettinen,
2009)*](https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/casebase/blob/master/references/Hanley_Miettinen-2009-Inter_J_of_Biostats.pdf).
